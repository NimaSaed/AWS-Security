<!-- 

Triage is often the first phase of the investigation process that is used to decide whether the finding is a real security issue or a false positive. Using Amazon Detective visualizations, you can see what resource, IP addresses, and AWS accounts are connected to that finding, related findings, and activity that occurred close in time or location to that finding, to quickly determine if the finding is an actual malicious activity or a false positive.

Some security findings require deep investigation to determine the extent of the malicious activity, its impact, and the underlying cause. When findings are identified by AWS Security services such as Amazon GuardDuty, you can go to Amazon Detective and immediately see context and activity related to the finding, drill down into relevant historical activities to identify unusual patterns and quickly determine the nature and extent of root cause and the activity that contributed to the finding. 

Threat hunting is a proactive analysis to uncover hidden threats based on certain clues or hypotheses. Amazon Detective helps with threat hunting by enabling you to focus on specific resources such as IP addresses, AWS accounts, VPC, and EC2 instances and providing detailed visualizations of activities associated with those resources. Amazon Detective helps with the hunting process by providing time-based analysis and the ability to drill in, see all the activities during a specific time period, and spot changes from the norm.
